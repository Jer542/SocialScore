# SocialScore

Welcome to SocialScore! This is an innovative platform that will allow you to login, assess, and score the privacy settings of your InstaGram account!  

The growth of social media will not slow down anytime soon. Unfortunately, with the growth of new platforms and users, privacy risks are increasing. Many default privacy settings leave new users of social networking sites open and vulnerable to cyberstalking, intelligence gathering, and even identity theft! 

Thankfully, there are ways to combat these privacy weaknesses through built-in privacy settings. Although, sometimes these settings are counter-intuitive and difficult to set up.  

However SocialScore will guide you in the right direction! Scoring your privacy on a numeric scale gives you a tangible representation of one of the most hidden gems in life, Privacy! 

Please note this project is still under-construction and as soon as the stable version is released this readme will be updated!
